What I learned about PHP 7 from this little project:

1. it is indeed quite fast (compared to what we had with the 5th version)
2. grouped imports are awesome, this is one of my most favorite features
3. the "spaceship" operator is also a very useful addition, I gave it a try it in this project
4. same goes for the null coalesce operator
5. but unfortunately, I had no chance to try out anonymous classes yet :(
6. I love scalar typehints and return type declarations
